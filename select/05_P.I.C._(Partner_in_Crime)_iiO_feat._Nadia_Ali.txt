Wherever I walk he'll always stroll along with me
As soon as I start to run he lays the whole track out for me
He holds on to my hand like as though it was jewelry
And when I lay down to sleep I swear he's the blanket over me

More and more I know, I know, I know
There is just one thing that's for sure
I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours

Let's hold on to what we've got 'cause we've got a lot, we've got
I'm asking it not to stop I won't let it drop, won t let it drop
Don't care where you've been before
Yesterday is yours, my love is blind
Promise to stick around 'cause I'll be lost without my partner in c

When my heart starts to sing he'll always carry the tune for me
Sometimes I'm shown to dance he moves the music to a beat
Oh, I sail through an ocean he's the water underneath
I have a smile on my face he brings the laughter out of me
